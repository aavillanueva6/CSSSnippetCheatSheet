# CSSSnippetCheatSheet #
This project contains blocks of code that can be used to execute specific styling in CSS. Parameters and class names need to be modified to suit the application.  


It is designed to be responsive to the user's screen width. For wide screens, the cards with the code blocks will display three per row.  For tablet sized screens (768-992 px wide) the cards will display two per row.  For phone sized screens (below 768 px wide) the cards will display one per row.

To select a block of code, click anywhere within the code block, and the site will select all of the code in the block.  This can then be copy/pasted into your code editor.
